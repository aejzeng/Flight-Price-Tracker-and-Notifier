# Flight-Price-Tracker-and-Notifier
Develop a Python-based flight price tracking system that automatically monitors the prices of flights from specified cities, updates a Google Sheet with relevant data, and sends alerts when cheaper flights are found. The project integrates web APIs (Flight Search, Sheety, and Twilio), web scraping, and automation techniques.
